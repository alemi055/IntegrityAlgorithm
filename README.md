# IntegrityAlgorithm
This guide explains the functioning of the R-based algorithm for assessing provirus integrity. Each provirus undergoes analysis to identify the presence of (i) inversions, (ii) hypermutations, (iii) large internal deletions, (iv) stop codons, (v) $\Psi$ defects, and (vi) small internal deletions in *gag*, *pol*, *vif*, *vpr*, *tat*, *rev*, *vpu*, *nef*, *env*, and RRE. Deleterious stop codons in any region except for *nef* are considered defects. Proviruses devoided of any of these defects are generally regarded as intact. The present algorithm combines the results from LANL's HIV Database QCTool and Gene Cutter, NIH's ProSeq-IT, and manual assessment using Geneious Prime.
