\title{
Infer the intactness of HIV proviruses
}
\description{
This function integrates the analyzes from all tools (\strong{Geneious}, \strong{QCTool}, \strong{Gene Cutter}, and \strong{Proseq-IT}) to infer the intactness of the provirus (\strong{intact} or \strong{defective}).

For each sequence, if the sequence is defective, it will detail all the defects in the \file{intactness_detailedsummary.csv} file (in the \strong{tmp} folder), or only the main defect (defects are hierarchized) in the \file{intactness_summary.csv} (in the \strong{FINAL_OUTPUT} folder).

It also outputs, in the \strong{tmp} folder, one .csv file per tool (QCTool: \file{Analyzed_QCTool.csv}; Gene Cutter: \file{Analyzed_GeneCutter.csv}; ProSeq-IT: \file{Analyzed_ProseqIT.csv}).

\usage{
HIV_IntegrityAnalysis(template_filename, QCTool_summary, ProseqIT_rx, ProseqIT_RefSeq = TRUE, RefSeq = TRUE, analyzes = 4)
}
\arguments{
  \item{template_filename}{
the name of the Excel template file
}
  \item{QCTool_summary}{
the name of the summary text (.txt) file downloaded from QCTool's output
}
  \item{ProseqIT_rx}{
the name of the summary Excel (.xls) file downloaded from ProSeq-IT
}
  \item{ProseqIT_RefSeq}{
logical. If \samp{TRUE}, the reference sequence is included in ProSeq-IT's results. Default is \samp{TRUE}
}
  \item{RefSeq}{
logical. If \samp{TRUE}, the reference sequence is included in QCTool's and Gene Cutter's results. Default is \samp{TRUE}
}
  \item{analyzes}{
integer. The functions to run. \samp{1}: QCTool only; \samp{2}: GeneCutter only; \samp{3}: ProSeq-IT only; \samp{4}: IntegrateInfo only; \samp{5}: All. Default is \samp{5}
}
}
\details{
To analyze the data, the function assesses the results from all tools: manual assessment with \strong{Geneious} (through the Excel template), \strong{QCTool}, \strong{Gene Cutter}, and \strong{Proseq-IT}.

Each provirus undergoes analysis to identify the presence of, in order, (\strong{i}) inversions, (\strong{ii}) hypermutations, (\strong{iii}) large internal deletions, (\strong{iv}) stop codons, (\strong{v}) \eqn{\Psi} defects, and (\strong{vi}) small internal deletions in gag, pol, vif, vpr, tat, rev, vpu, nef, env, and RRE.

The defects are either hierarchized (i.e., only one defect per sequence, see \file{intactness_summary.csv} file) or not (exhaustive list of all defects, see \file{intactness_detailedsummary.csv}).

\strong{Troubleshooting}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\code{Warning in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")): cannot open file 'tmp/Analyzed_QCTool.csv': No such file or directory}\cr
\code{Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")): cannot open the connection}

This error occurs when the user does not have administrative rights. To fix this error, manually create the folders: \strong{tmp} and \strong{FINAL_OUTPUT}.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\code{Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE): arguments imply differing number of rows: 11, 10}

This type of error occurs when the number of sequences between all files and tools (Excel template, QCTool, Gene Cutter, and ProSeq-IT) is not the same and/or in the same order.

To fix this error, check the temporary .csv files (in the \strong{tmp} folder) and verify at which tool the number of sequences varies. It could be in the downloaded files (QCTool's summary .txt file and/or ProSeq-IT's .xls file) as well.

It can sometimes happen when the reference sequence is present (or absent) in one of the tools, and the \samp{RefSeq} and \samp{ProseqIT_RefSeq} options have not been modified.
