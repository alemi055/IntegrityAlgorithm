\title{
Integrate information of all tools
}
\description{
This function integrates the analyzes from all tools (\strong{Geneious}, \strong{QCTool}, \strong{Gene Cutter}, and \strong{Proseq-IT}) to infer the intactness of the provirus (\strong{intact} or \strong{defective}).

For each sequence, if the sequence is defective, it will detail all the defects in the \file{intactness_detailedsummary.csv} file (in the \strong{tmp} folder), or only the main defect (defects are hierarchized) in the \file{intactness_summary.csv} (in the \strong{FINAL_OUTPUT} folder).
}
\usage{
IntegrateInfo(filename)
}
\arguments{
  \item{filename}{
the name of the Excel template file
}
}
\details{
To analyze the data, the function assesses the results from all tools: manual assessment with Geneious (through the Excel template), QCTool, Gene Cutter, and Proseq-IT. This function is used in the main function HIV_IntegrityAnalysis().

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\code{Warning in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")): cannot open file 'tmp/Analyzed_QCTool.csv': No such file or directory}\cr
\code{Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")): cannot open the connection}

This error occurs when the user does not have administrative rights. To fix this error, manually create the folders: \strong{tmp} and \strong{FINAL_OUTPUT}.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\code{Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE): arguments imply differing number of rows: 11, 10}

This type of error occurs when the number of sequences between all files and tools (Excel template, QCTool, Gene Cutter, and ProSeq-IT) is not the same and/or in the same order.

To fix this error, check the temporary .csv files (in the \strong{tmp} folder) and verify at which tool the number of sequences varies. It could be in the downloaded files (QCTool's summary .txt file and/or ProSeq-IT's .xls file) as well.

It can sometimes happen when the reference sequence is present (or absent) in one of the tools, and the \samp{RefSeq} and \samp{ProseqIT_RefSeq} options have not been modified.
