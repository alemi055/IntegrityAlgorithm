\title{
Identify defects in Env
}
\description{
This function identifies HIV Env defects in sequences based on ProSeq-IT's results, except for the stop codons (Gene Cutter). It returns, for each sequence, a data frame summarizing the presence or absence (0 or 1) of Env defects. Further details are added in the 'env_defects_comments' if there is a defect.
}
\usage{
env_small_delet(ProseqIT_rx, ProseqIT_criteria, Analyzed_GeneCutter)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ProseqIT_rx}{
Data frame containing the results from ProSeq-IT (the Excel downloaded file)
}
  \item{ProseqIT_criteria}{
Data frame containing, for each ProSeq-IT annotation, the criteria used to infer proviral intactness
}
  \item{Analyzed_GeneCutter}{
Data frame containing the analyzed results from Gene Cutter
}
}
\details{
Based on ProSeq-IT's values 'env_insertion', 'env_deletion', 'env_frameshift' (to see values, see "ProseqIT_criteria" tab of the Excel template). To be considered "intact", the Env ORF must have a start codon, no frameshift, and insertions/deletions representing <5\% of its length. For this function to work, Gene Cutter's results must have been previously analyzed and ProSeq-IT's output Excel file must be in the user's current directory. This function is used in the main function ProseqIT_analyzes().
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing the Pol defects.
